<p> FastOpen is a plugin designed to quickly open any file
in the current project by just typing in the first few
characters of the filename you want to open. Besides
quickly opening any file, it has a lot of features like
switching between projects, indicating invalid
filenames, opening non-project files, opening files
from "Recent List" and more! </p>
